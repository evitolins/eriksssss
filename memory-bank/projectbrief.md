# Project Brief

Project: eriksssss (personal/portfolio website)

Purpose

- Maintain a single-file static site / portfolio for the author (Ev).
- Showcase projects, animation work, music, mixtapes, and development experiments.
- Serve as the canonical personal website with minimal dependencies (static HTML/CSS + small JS assets).

Goals

- Keep site lightweight, fast, and easily maintainable.
- Preserve project history, creative artifacts, and documentation for future updates.
- Provide an easily browsable structure for portfolio assets (images, pages, demos).

Primary Users / Stakeholders

- Owner: Ev (site author/maintainer)
- Site visitors: employers, collaborators, and general audience interested in portfolio or creative work.

Success Criteria

- Memory Bank exists with required core files (productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md).
- Memory Bank documents are clear, concise, and usable as the single source of truth for future sessions.
- New contributors (or Cline after memory reset) can read memory-bank files to understand project purpose, current focus, and next steps.

Scope & Deliverables

- Create `memory-bank/` directory with core markdown files:
  - projectbrief.md (this file)
  - productContext.md
  - activeContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - techContext.md
  - progress.md
- Populate initial content for all files that captures project intent, current status, and next actions.

Constraints & Assumptions

- Project remains a static site stored in this repository.
- Memory Bank will be updated alongside significant changes or when requested explicitly via "update memory bank".
- Files must be kept in Markdown and located at `memory-bank/` for Cline to find them reliably.

Initial Timeline

- Initialize Memory Bank (create files): immediate.
- Populate and refine Memory Bank content: ongoing as features change.

Contact / Maintainer

- Repository remote: git@github.com:evitolins/eriksssss.git
- Owner: Ev (maintainer and primary decision maker)

Notes

- This file is the foundation for other Memory Bank documents. Subsequent files will expand on product motivation, active work, system patterns, technologies, and progress tracking.
