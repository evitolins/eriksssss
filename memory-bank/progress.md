Timestamps

- Memory Bank initialization started: 2025-09-03 10:37:47 (local)
- Core files created: 2025-09-03 10:37–10:41 (local)

What works (Completed)

- Memory Bank directory exists at `memory-bank/`.
- All six required core Markdown files have been created and contain initial content.
- Files include guidance for contributors, architecture notes, tech stack, active work, and next steps.

What's next (Pending)

- Optional: Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` or a checklist for adding new portfolio items (recommended).
- Optionally add small utility scripts:
  - thumbnail generation / image optimization script
  - image audit script
- Periodically review and update Memory Bank files when:
  - New tooling is added
  - Hosting/deploy workflows change
  - Major content strategy updates (e.g., adding a blog)

Known issues & notes

- Content is initial and intentionally concise — expand entries when recurring patterns require explicit instructions (e.g., detailed Flickity init snippets).
- Large media assets live in `imgs/`; consider a periodic audit to reduce repo size if needed.

Next actionable items (ordered)

1. (Optional) Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` documenting:
   - File naming conventions
   - Preferred image sizes and formats
   - Local preview and deploy steps
2. Review repository for duplicate/oversized images and create thumbnails where appropriate.
3. If automation is desired, implement a small script to:
   - Generate optimized thumbnails
   - Replace large PNGs with WebP variants where appropriate
4. Keep Memory Bank files up-to-date:
   - Update `activeContext.md` when priorities change
   - Update `progress.md` as tasks complete

Owner / Maintainer

- Ev (repository owner and primary decision maker)

Change log (initial)

- 2025-09-03: Created Memory Bank and populated core files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`.

Notes for Cline

- On future sessions, Cline MUST read all files in `memory-bank/` at start of task per project rules.
- Use these files as the single source of truth for project context, active work, and next steps.
