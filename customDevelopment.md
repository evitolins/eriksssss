Custom Development & Design
===================================
Here is a basic breakdown of my services, recommendations and rates.



Infrastructure
-----------------------
### Domain
I recommend [whois.com](https://whois.com) for purchasing domain names. Most available domains cost about _$9.88/year_

### Hosting
For basic web hosting, I recommend [hostgator.com](http://www.hostgator.com/shared) for it's price and usability. This hosting service is simple and pretty cheap, and has all the features to support Wordpress and custom sites.

> To save time and avoid confusion, it's often easiest for me to setup any infrastructure.  Just let me know what options you prefer.
>
> Custom websites and Wordpress sites require hosting.  Services like Squarespace include hosting with their packages.



Services
-----------------------
### Website ($75/hour, minimum $1200)
Depending on the site needs, turnaround time, and budget, I can recommend the best option for your particular project.

#### A) TEMPLATED WEBSITE
For basic needs, this is often the best choice for the price.  Using systems such as [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) or [Squarespace](https://squarespace.com) allow polished site behavior out of the box, and have tons of plugins for enhanced features such as blogs, contact forms, and e-commerce systems.

#### B) CUSTOM WEBSITE
For those websites that require features and design that templates can not provide, it's best to create a site from scratch.  These sites often
take the most time to complete, but are most flexible for those who require very specific layouts and/or behavior.


> __Required Information__
> - All the content to be displayed (text, photos, menu, address, phone number...)
> - What type of functionality does the site need (contact form, blog, e-commerce, etc...)
> - Does the site need to be "responsive" (adjusts automatically for smaller screens such as mobile devices)

> __Wordpress__
> - Initial installation requires about 1-2 hours.
> - Purchased template's cost included in invoice. Installation time may vary.


### Business Cards ($75/hour)
I can help design, layout and order business cards.  A basic design take about 1-3 hours.

[moo.com](http://us.moo.com/products/original-business-cards.html) is a great service, but I'm open to any service you might find.

> __Required Information__
> - Background Color
> - Size (typically 3.5"x2")
> - Quantity
> - Info (logo, name(s), address, phone number, email, website, etc...)


Other Info
-----------------------

### Rushed Jobs
Each rush contract is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and are at a _25% rate increase_
