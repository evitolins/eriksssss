Custom Development & Design
===================================
Here is a basic breakdown of my services, costs and recommendations.

Please take a look at the information below, and let me know if you have any questions.  The faster I can get the content, the faster I can estimate the time needed, and get started ;) 



Hardware
-----------------------

### Domain
I recommend [](whois.com) for purchasing domain names. Most domains cost about _$9.88/year_

### Hosting
For basic web hosting, I recommend [hostgator.com](http://www.hostgator.com/shared) for it's priceThis hosting service is simple and pretty cheap, and has what it needs for your needs.  The longer the plan, the cheaper it is per month.  How many years would you want to purchase?

__"Hatchling Plan"__
- 1 year: $5.56/mo
- 2 year: $4.76/mo
- 3 year: $3.96/mo

> Custom websites and Wordpress sites require hosting.  Services like Squarespace include hosting with their packages.



Development Services
-----------------------
### Website ($75/hour, minimum $1200)
Depending on the site needs, turnaround time, and budget, I can recommend the best option for your particular project.

#### CUSTOM WEBSITE
For those websites that require features and design that templates can not provide, it's best to create a site from scratch.  These sites often
take the most time to complete, but are most flexible for those who require very specific layouts and/or behavior.

#### TEMPLATED WEBSITE
For basic needs, this is often the best choice for the price.  Using systems such as Wordpress or Squarespace allows polished site behavior out of the box, and often includes choices for plugins for features such as blogs, contact forms, and e-commerce.


__Information I need__
- All the content to be displayed (text, photos, menu, address, phone numberâ€¦)
- What type of functionality does the site need (contact form, blog)
- Does the site need to be "responsive" (adjusts automatically for smaller screens such as mobile devices)


> Wordpress initial installation requires about 1-2 hours.
> Wordpress Templates cost is invoiced. Installation time may vary.



### Logo ($75/hour)
I can build an Illustrator file of your logo, and make any changes you need.  I'm estimating about 2 hours time to create it, and probably 1 hour of making any fixes that you may need.

__Helpful Info and Suggetions__
- light background version
- dark background version
- monochrome version


### Business Cards ($75/hour)
I can help design, layout and order business cards.  A basic design take about 1-3 hours.

[moo.com](http://us.moo.com/products/original-business-cards.html) is a great service, but I'm open to any service you might find.
