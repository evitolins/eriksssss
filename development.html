            <h2>Frontend development</h2>
            <p>
              Frontend development provides a wide range of scale and technical
              challenges -- from building a simple SPA website, to deploying
              robust, cloud-based service consoles for AWS. I have years of
              experience working with stakeholders (product, UX, backend
              engineers, customers, etc), to bring their visions to reality in a
              scalable, secure way -- while ensuring the user/customer has the
              best experience possible.

            <p>
              As a tool developer for the creative digital space, I've had
              several opportunities to consult, design, and build solutions for
              several VFX/animation studios. By meeting with the artists,
              engineers and supervisors, I can identify and discuss any lacking
              features, existing bottlenecks, and workflow issues within their
              organization. Afterwards, I can propose my recommended solutions
              and work with the team to prioritize these goals and execute them.

                <p>
                  Collaborating with the product, UX, and management teams, our
                  frontend team delivered a user-friendly onboarding experience
                  that enables setup and monitoring of Deadline render servers
                  in the cloud. This included designing, deploying, and
                  maintaining a secure, scalable service admin console and
                  artist-monitor application. We also built and supported a full
                  CI/CD pipeline, metrics, alarms, dashboards, end-to-end tests,
                  and canaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We balanced AWS design and security guidelines along with
                  customer needs, by working closely with our Product and UX
                  teams to design, execute, and refine the customer experience
                  based on detailed mocks and design documentation.

                <p>
                  Our former client Nimble Collective decided that RGB was a
                  good fit for their platform and so we decided to join them
                  along for the ride to launch a fully managed
                  studio-in-the-cloud.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the acquisition, we started work to integrate the two
                  products.

                  With the help of the team that I organized, we designed and
                  built browser-based video review SAAS featuring advanced
                  sketch-over and key-framing tools. The implementation
                  leveraged the browser’s Audio, Video, and Canvas APIs.

                <h3>Animation Utilities Consultant and Developer</h3>
                <p>
                  I was hired as an Animation Technical Director to evaluate,
                  propose and execute updates to existing tools and to develop
                  new tools based on their specifications. The high level goals
                  for all of these contributions were as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Tools should be future-proof and have the ability to adapt
                    to future production requirements
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    UI/UX should be intuitive and responsive allowing the
                    artists to work more efficiently to achieve their creative
                    goals
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    UX design should include details such as input validation
                    and helpful error messaging can guide artists toward success
                    more quickly
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Tools should be well documented to allow clear understanding
                    of they're usage, and their maintenance
                  </li>

                <h3>Animation Development</h3>
                <p>
                  The Animation Development Team ("AnimDev") consisted of
                  several senior animators (including myself) to oversee and
                  improve the workflows, rigs, and tools animators rely on to
                  produce high-quality content quickly. We collaborated with
                  stakeholders (modeling, rigging, technical anim, lighting, vfx
                  &amp; anim directors) to ensure artists could both consume and
                  deliver consistent, predictable assets. By overseeing all
                  concurrent productions, we consolidated solutions that worked
                  globally and avoided one-off fixes.
                </p>

                <h3>Character/Rig Supervision</h3>
                <p>
                  Coordinating with upstream and downstream animation
                  stakeholders, I worked closely with artists and supervisors to
                  ensure rigs met animators&apos; control and performance needs.
                  With multiple productions of experience, I helped establish
                  rig UX guidelines, scalable design principles, quality
                  standards, and production-wide tools and workflows — all of
                  which helped streamline future productions.

                <p>
                  While a lead animator at Rhythm & Hues, I also developed and
                  supported 20+ widely used scripted tools
                  <em>"AnimTools"</em> for the award-winning, proprietary
                  animation software <em>"Voodoo"</em>.
