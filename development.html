          <h1>Building solutions for over a decade</h1>
          <p>
            I am a self-taught engineer with 15+ years of professional
            development experience. I am continually driven to utilize
            technology to solve real-world problems, whether that is to help AWS
            customers onboard to a cloud-based rendering service or to build
            customized tools that help artists better perform their tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've bootstrapped and launched SaaS services under my leadership,
            co-founded a VR game studio, and also worked on large development
            teams in a corporate environment. These experiences have shaped me
            as a developer and how I approach solving problems at different
            scales. I've gained the expertise to evaluate the needs of the
            customer and design and deliver a scalable, maintainable solution
            that provides a delightful experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additionally, with my professional background in character animation
            and development for feature film visual effects, I also offer a
            unique skill set to assist within the CG industry. I love to
            leverage both my technical and creative skills together when
            possible, and I have often found myself becoming a bridge between
            creative and technical teams. I truly enjoy designing and improving
            artist workflows and pipelines to help teams of artists concentrate
            on the creative process.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lastly, I take pride in helping others and sharing my experience and
            knowledge with colleagues. During my career, I've made it a point to
            assist junior developers and other colleagues to ensure the team
            thrives and grows. I also encourage teams to formalize internal
            education and mentoring programs so the teams are able to grow as a
            whole.

            <h2>Frontend development</h2>
            <p>
              Frontend development provides a wide range of scale and technical
              challenges—from building a simple SPA website to deploying robust,
              cloud-based service consoles for AWS. I have years of experience
              working with stakeholders (product, UX, backend engineers,
              customers, etc.) to bring their visions to reality in a scalable,
              secure way—while ensuring the user/customer has the best
              experience possible.

            <h2>Backend development</h2>
            <p>
              Over the years I've been a part of several projects where it was
              required to both design and maintain proprietary backends for
              web-based services and websites. This includes service APIs,
              deployment pipelines, operations, metrics, and dashboards. When
              building backend solutions, I'm able to concentrate on building
              solutions for the expected scale and capacity while ensuring
              availability and visibility. Below are areas that I have years of
              experience with:
            </p>

              <li>CI/CD pipeline design/management</li>
              <li>Operations monitoring</li>
              <li>REST API design and deployment</li>
              <li>NoSQL and SQL database design</li>
              <li>Realtime/push-based application features</li>
              <li>
                Service integration (Shotgun, Slack, Github, proprietary service
                APIs, ...)
              </li>

            <h2>Creative tools and workflow development</h2>
            <p>
              As a tool developer for the creative digital space, I've had
              several opportunities to research, design, and build both
              time-saving and quality-increasing solutions for several
              VFX/animation studios.
            </p>
            <p>
              Working with the artists, engineers, supervisors, and directors, I
              can help identify and discuss solutions for bottlenecks, missing
              features, possible workflow issues and other future goals for
              improving artists' workflow. After which, I can work with the team
              to design and propose my recommended solutions and to plan and
              prioritize the execution of the chosen design.

                <h3>Building an AWS cloud service from the ground up</h3>
                <p>
                  In 2018, I joined AWS as a frontend engineer. I worked with
                  both the original Nimble Collective team members and AWS
                  veterans to help design and implement a new AWS service based
                  on Nimble Collective and RGB Notes. This required a complete
                  rebuild of the original services, using AWS' internal
                  infrastructure, cloud services, and proprietary UI framework.
                  Once designs were settled, I delivered several key UI
                  components for the service's admin console, including
                  onboarding and resource management UX flows within the
                  service's admin console.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the backend, I implemented a series of metrics, dashboards,
                  and alarms to monitor the availability and performance of the
                  service. I also implemented unit and E2E testing in a CI/CD
                  pipeline, ensuring service stability and catching flaws before
                  being deployed to production.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After 1 1/2 years of constructing this new AWS-based service
                  from the ground up, we launched the Amazon Nimble Studio to a
                  general audience on April 28, 2021. I continued on the UI team
                  to support the live service, deploy new features, and
                  continually improve the UX for customers.
                </p>

                <h3>Launching Amazon Deadline Cloud</h3>

                <p>
                  After Amazon Nimble Cloud launched, our internal organization
                  took focus on cloud-based rendering and management. A new team
                  was assembled to deliver this new service to complement Nimble
                  Studio. I soon shifted to this team to assist in development
                  and launch.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the team was on an accelerated schedule to iterate on the
                  UI/UX design, I stepped in to backfill the lack of E2E testing
                  infrastructure and coverage for the admin console UI and
                  portal application. I designed and implemented multi-step form
                  patterns to accommodate onboarding and management wizard UX
                  designs. These featured robust form submission with
                  conditional asynchronous request patterns and graceful error
                  handling and messaging.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On April 2, 2024, I successfully orchestrated the UI team's
                  deployment of the AWS admin console during the Amazon Deadline
                  Cloud's official production launch.

                <h3>Acquisition and service integration</h3>
                <p>
                  In 2018, as the founder of RGB Notes LLC (see below), I
                  accepted the acquisition offer from our former client Nimble
                  Collective. Their studio-in-the-cloud service was well
                  complemented by the animation review features that RGB
                  provided. After joining, we quickly got to work on integrating
                  the 2 services directly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Only several months later, Amazon Web Services (AWS) made an
                  offer to acquire Nimble Collective. Our final task before the
                  acquisition was finalized was to transition the codebase to
                  meet the security standards of AWS.

                <h3>Bootstrapping a SaaS startup</h3>
                <p>
                  After working as a professional animator for close to a
                  decade, it became clear that quality communication tools were
                  required to ensure that creative direction was expressed
                  clearly and efficiently. This was especially true with remote
                  work and satellite studios becoming the norm. Some large
                  studios like Disney or Pixar were able to support their own
                  proprietary systems, but there was little to no public
                  software or service that allowed artists to share and review
                  their work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because of this, RGB Notes was born. After the unfortunate
                  bankruptcy of Rhythm and Hues, I took the opportunity as a
                  positive to pursue building a service that I felt was missing
                  from the creative industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the help of the team that I organized, I designed and
                  built browser-based video review SaaS featuring advanced
                  sketch-over and key-framing tools. The service provided many
                  technical challenges, including secure sign-in, media
                  transcoding, user notification, REST API design, and an
                  advanced drawing/brush engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Until mid-2018, RGB Notes served thousands of clients,
                  including Nimble Collective, Chapman University, and
                  AnimSchool. From there, I was able to lead the team towards a
                  successful acquisition, joining Nimble Collective to provide a
                  powerful cloud-based studio for artists.

                <h3>Animation Utilities Consultation and Development</h3>
                <p>
                  I accepted a short contract as an Animation Technical Director
                  to evaluate and develop solutions to help streamline
                  bottlenecks within the animation department's workflow. This
                  included developing both new tools and upgrades to existing
                  tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As my contract was short, I quickly onboarded and worked
                  closely with representatives from the rigging, software,
                  pipeline and animation departments. I delivered multiple
                  solutions to streamline their current workflows, allowing
                  artists improved control over their animation. I also
                  introduced new patterns to better handle differences commonly
                  found between productions. This replaced the previous, less
                  maintainable approach of branching individual tool versions
                  for each production.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Animation Development Team ("AnimDev") was a small group
                  of senior animators (including myself) tasked to oversee and
                  improve the workflows, rigs, and tools animators rely on to
                  produce high-quality content quickly. I worked closely with
                  animation stakeholders (modeling, rigging, technical
                  animation, lighting, VFX &amp; animation directors) to ensure
                  artists received capable, consistent rigs and workflows that
                  empowered them rather than slowed them down. By overseeing all
                  productions concurrently, the AnimDev team developed trusted
                  relationships with other departments and was able to help
                  consolidate solutions that work globally and avoid one-off
                  fixes.

                  Coordinating with upstream and downstream animation
                  stakeholders, I worked closely with artists and supervisors to
                  ensure rigs met animators&apos; control and performance needs.
                  With multiple productions of experience, I helped establish
                  rig UX guidelines, scalable design principles, quality
                  standards, and production-wide tools and workflows—all of
                  which helped streamline future productions.

                <h3>Animation Tool Development</h3>
                <p>
                  While a lead animator at Rhythm & Hues, I found that many of
                  the tasks that I and others performed as artists could be
                  streamlined. I took extra time to design and build solutions
                  for myself, and soon a library of over 20 utilities was
                  deployed and supported for production use by over 160
                  animators across all 5 satellite studios.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The increased efficiency these tools provided saved the
                  department roughly 800 person-hours of work (~$45,000) per
                  week.
