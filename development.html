            <p>
              Frontend development provides a wide range of scale and technical
              challenges -- from building a simple SPA website, to deploying
              robust, cloud-based service consoles for AWS. I have years of
              experience working with stakeholders (product, UX, backend
              engineers, customers, etc), to bring their visions to reality in a
              scalable, secure way -- while ensuring the user/customer has the
              best experience possible.

              features, existing bottlenecks, and workflow issues within their
              organization. Afterwards, I can propose my recommended solutions

                  Collaborating with the product, UX, and management teams, our
                  frontend team delivered a user-friendly onboarding experience
                  that enables setup and monitoring of Deadline render servers
                  in the cloud. This included designing, deploying, and
                  maintaining a secure, scalable service admin console and
                  artist-monitor application. We also built and supported a full
                  CI/CD pipeline, metrics, alarms, dashboards, end-to-end tests,
                  and canaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We balanced AWS design and security guidelines along with
                  customer needs, by working closely with our Product and UX
                  teams to design, execute, and refine the customer experience
                  based on detailed mocks and design documentation.

                  new tools based on their specifications. The high level goals
                  for all of these contributions were as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Tools should be future-proof and have the ability to adapt
                    to future production requirements
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    UI/UX should be intuitive and responsive allowing the
                    artists to work more efficiently to achieve their creative
                    goals
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    UX design should include details such as input validation
                    and helpful error messaging can guide artists toward success
                    more quickly
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Tools should be well documented to allow clear understanding
                    of they're usage, and their maintenance
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Animation Development</h3>
                <p>
                  The Animation Development Team ("AnimDev") consisted of
                  several senior animators (including myself) to oversee and
                  improve the workflows, rigs, and tools animators rely on to
                  produce high-quality content quickly. We collaborated with
                  stakeholders (modeling, rigging, technical anim, lighting, vfx
                  &amp; anim directors) to ensure artists could both consume and
                  deliver consistent, predictable assets. By overseeing all
                  concurrent productions, we consolidated solutions that worked
                  globally and avoided one-off fixes.
                </p>

                <h3>Character/Rig Supervision</h3>
                <p>
                  I coordinated with upstream and downstream animation
                  stakeholders to ensure rigs met animators&quot; control and
                  performance needs. I also established rig UX guidelines,
                  scalable design principles, quality standards, and
                  production-wide tools and workflows.

                <h3>Animation Tool Development</h3>
                <p>
                  While a lead animator at Rhythm & Hues, I also developed and
                  supported 20+ widely used scripted tools "AnimTools" for
                  <em>Voodoo</em>, their award-winning proprietary animation
                  software.
