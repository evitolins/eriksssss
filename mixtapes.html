        <p>Follow me on a journey into the past, dusting off mixtapes from years ago.  Some made by me, and many made by my aunt and uncle, who clearly have amazing taste.  Please enjoy :)</p>

                    <p>This single mixtape was given to me by my Aunt Linda, and I clearly remember listening to this while doing homework in Jr. High.  Quite a few 80's tracks from off the beaten path, that I haven't heard since I'd dug up this treasure.</p>

                  <p>Another tape by Aunt Linda which shows the lighter side of the 80's.  Probably developed to be less distracting in times where real concentration was required to cram for that next exam tomorrow.</p>
                  <p>The second side of the tape is labeled "Clean up your room... and then return to sappy study music"</p>
                  <p>There's quite a bit of lovey-dovy stuff on this tape. I'm curious what Auntie Linda was going through during this tapes creation.  Quite a different selection than other mixes.</p>

                  <p>I created this tape as an ode to classic rock, carefully choosing the perfect arc of energy from beginning to end - while taking pride in filling the tape completely, without compromise.
                  <p>This tape got a lot of use on the backroads north of our hometown.  Escaping the clutches of the Carmel Police Department, we would drive for hours through the farmlands of Indiana enjoying good tunes and good company.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately the empire of The Beatles is well protected, so finding all the tracks for this tape proved difficult on Grooveshark.  I did my best to fill in the gaps with worthy covers, if not the original</p>

                  <p>Jaclyn was a HUGE Smashing Pumpkins fan, among other things.  While I never appreciated them as much as she ever did, I learned more about them and many other bands than from any gal I'd ever come across. Thanks Jaclyn.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, Grooveshark is missing 2 Smashing Pumpkins rarities from the original mix: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73eG5zQIYXE">"Pennies"</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90v2hrrijds">"Slunk"</a>.  It's too bad, they're pretty good tunes.</p>
